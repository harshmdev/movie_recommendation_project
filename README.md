## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on movies, including:

- **Title**
- **Rating**
- **Runtime**
- **Genre**
- **Metascore**
- **Plot**
- **Director**
- **Stars**
- **Vote Count**
- **Gross Earnings**
- **Year of Release**
- **Writer**
- **Image Link**

Data was sourced from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) .

## Modeling Approach

The recommendation system combines several machine learning techniques:

- **CountVectorizer** for text-based features like genres, directors, stars, etc.
- **Word2Vec** for plot analysis.
- **MinMaxScaler** for normalizing numerical features like the year of release.
- **Cosine Similarity**  for calculating similarities between movies.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using Docker. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t movie-recommender .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 movie-recommender
    ```

3. **Access the app** by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

4. **Pull the docker image** i already deploy it on docker "harshmdev/movie_recommendation:01" to pull it 
    ```bash
    docker pull harshmdev/movie_recommendation:01
    ```

## Future Improvements

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Incorporate user data to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Update the recommendation engine to provide real-time suggestions based on ongoing user interactions.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more sophisticated visualizations to analyze movie trends and data.
- **Integration with External APIs**: Fetch the latest movie data dynamically from external APIs like TMDb or IMDb.
